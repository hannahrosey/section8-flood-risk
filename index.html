          <h5>How I found the statistics in this map</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Estimated % of voucher households in a floodplain:</strong> This is the total number of voucher holders by census tract, joined to 100- and 500-year floodplains at the census tract level. Next, the sum of voucher households in the flood plain is divided by the sum of total voucher households in the PUMA to get a PUMA-level share</li>
              <li><strong>Reported households and individuals:</strong> This is the sum of total reported households and individuals for census tracts in each PUMA. <i>Reported</i> households are those that filled out the certification paperwork in the time period when this report was prepared, and underestimates the total number of households. Data are also omitted by HUD in census tracts with fewer than 11 voucher households due to privacy concerns.</li>
              <li><strong>Avg. household size:</strong> This is the sum of total reported individuals in a PUMA, divided by the sum of total reported households in a PUMA.</li>
              <li><strong>Estimated households and individuals:</strong> Estimated households is the total HCVP <i>units</i> in a census tract multiplied by the <i>percent occupied</i> figure provided by HUD to get an estimate of the number of households. This is summed at the PUMA level. Then, it is multiplied by the average household size at the PUMA level to get an estimate of individuals.</li>

          <h5>What is HCVP?</h5>
          <p>The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program is a key support for low-income renters. According to the <a href=“https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/oor/2021/Out-of-Reach_2021.pdf”>National Low Income Housing Coalition</a>, a New York state renter making the minimum wage in 2021 needed to work 109 hours a week to afford a 2-bedroom home. The HCVP supports renters in this untenable situation by paying the portion of a participant’s rent above 30% of their income. In addition, many policymakers focused on how racial and economic segregation  see vouchers as a way to expand people’s choices about where they live. About 124,000 people use these vouchers in New York City, including 85,000 served by the <a href=“https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/section-8/about-section-8.page#:~:text=Approximately%2085%2C000%20Section%208%20vouchers,programs%20in%20New%20York%20City”>New York City Housing Authority</a> and 39,000 served by the <a href=“https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/about-section-8.page”>Department of Housing Preservation and Development</a>. </p>

          <h5>What do floodplains have to do with it?</h5>
          <p>Climate change is leading to more frequent and severe storm events, which sea level rise will exacerbate. Storm events not only cause immediate threats to people’s safety, like floods, but also cause problems that can effect people over the long-term: damage to vital transportation systems, health effects from exposure to mold or chronic stress, and displacement, to name a few. Low-income renters are most vulnerable to these problems. Voucher households can protect themselves by choosing low-risk neighborhoods, and policymakers can help by allocating funding for counselors who assist voucherholders in finding the best home for them. That definition should include free of flood risk.</p>

            This map shows where NYC households using the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) live, and compares that map to flood risk in the 2020s based on estimates of sea level rise. It uses Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAS), a census estimate of neighborhood geographies. Toggle between 100- and 500-year flood plains, hover over PUMAs to get information on the estimated number of HCVP households at risk, and click a PUMA to dive into the data.
