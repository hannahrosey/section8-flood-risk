# Mapping Flood Risk and where Housing Choice Voucher Holders Live

# About the project
Climate change increases the risks of severe storms and flooding. The Housing Choice Voucher Program, also referred to as Section 8, provides rental assistance to low-income tenants, many of whom are vulnerable to natural disasters. This map aims to map HUD data on where residents use vouchers with NYC floodplains.
